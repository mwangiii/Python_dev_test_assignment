# Python **Developer** Test Assignment

Create a web application (website) where a user enters the name of a city and receives a weather forecast for that city for the near future.

- *The data (weather forecast) should be displayed in an easily readable format.*

- You can use any web framework.

- Weather API: *https://open-meteo.com/* (or another one if you prefer).

It would be a plus if:

- Tests are written.
- Everything is placed in a Docker container.
- Autocompletion (suggestions) is provided when entering a city.
- Upon revisiting the site, the user is prompted to check the weather in a city they have previously looked up.
- Search history is saved for each user, and there is an API that shows how many times each city has been searched.

Evaluation criteria:

- Functionality
- Usability
- Code quality

In the [README.md](http://readme.md/), please indicate what was done from the above list, a few words about the technologies used, and how to run everything.
